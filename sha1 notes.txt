JtR can do >= 38 million SHA-1 iterations per core on a i5-6500 CPU.

We need to do (2 ^ 32) * 3 SHA-1 operations in total in the `algorithm`.

So the total time needed to exhaust this keyspace is ~340 seconds on a single
core. We can reduce this to 85 seconds by using all the 4 cores.

JtR's SHA1 and SHA512 code is pretty optimal,
